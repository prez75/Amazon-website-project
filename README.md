# Amazon-website-project

A functional web prototype: users register, log in, pick a role (student / parent / educator), and see T-Level information tailored to that role. Includes accessibility settings (dark mode, larger text, high contrast) and a contact/feedback form.

Academic / trademark disclaimer This is a student prototype built for an educational exercise. The "Amazon" name and styling are used only to resemble the brief. It is not affiliated with or endorsed by Amazon. Do not deploy publicly or present it as a real Amazon product.

Run it locally
You need Python 3.9+.

# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Asmae-aitabdallah/amazon-student.git
cd amazon-student

# 2. (Skip if you already have the folder) or just go into the project folder
# cd amazon_student

# 3. (Recommended) create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # macOS/Linux
# venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows (PowerShell)

# 4. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 5. (Recommended) set a fixed secret key so sessions survive restarts
export FLASK_SECRET_KEY="change-this-to-a-long-random-string"   # macOS/Linux
# setx FLASK_SECRET_KEY "change-this-..."                       # Windows

# 6. Run
python app.py
Then open http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser.

The database (database.db) is created automatically the first time you run the app. Register an account, then log in.

Security practices used (and why)
Password hashing — passwords are stored as PBKDF2-SHA256 hashes via Werkzeug's generate_password_hash. Plaintext is never stored.
SQL injection prevention — every query uses parameterised statements (? placeholders), so user input can never be executed as SQL.
Session security — the session cookie is signed with SECRET_KEY, marked HttpOnly (JS can't read it) and SameSite=Lax (basic CSRF mitigation). The session is rotated on login to prevent session fixation.
Input validation — all form input is validated server-side (email format, password length, role whitelist, message length). Client-side HTML attributes are convenience only.
No user enumeration — login returns the same error whether the email is unknown or the password is wrong.
Known limitations (honest list)
These are deliberately out of scope for a prototype but would matter in production:

No CSRF tokens on forms. SameSite=Lax helps, but a real app should use Flask-WTF's CSRF protection on every POST.
No rate limiting / lockout on login, so brute-force attempts aren't slowed.
No email verification or password reset flow.
Accessibility prefs are per-device (localStorage), not tied to the account.
debug=True is set for development convenience — never run that in production.
Output escaping: Jinja2 auto-escapes by default (good), but if you ever mark content |safe, validate it first to avoid XSS.
